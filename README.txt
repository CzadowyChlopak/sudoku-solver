The sudoku solver Python project I wrote at 2nd year of studies to pass a subject called 'Image processing and computer graphics'. The mathematical model loaded into Keras is not written by me - I took it from internet and I didn't save any source link. This model is used to detect numbers from pictures and create values from them using prediction.

In the later project I developed my own model which has accuracy prediction on the level of 98%.
